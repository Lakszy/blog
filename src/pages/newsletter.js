      <p>
        Why should you subscribe? Well, why not? If you like some of my blog
        posts or talks, I will send you an email when I release a new one. That
        means <b>FREE</b> knowledge, tips, and pineapples üçç.
      </p>

      <p>
        At most, it will be a couple of emails a year. Can your mailbox undergo
        that many emails? If the answer is yes, subscribe and let us keep in
        touch. You can always unsubscribe later!
