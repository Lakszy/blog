# Shorten URLs with Cloudflare Workers

Hi there,

Here's what has happened on the Pragmatic Pineapple blog since the last newsletter issue.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [A Guide to Intersection Observer](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/intersection-observer-guide/)

Come and learn about the Intersection Observer API that lives and breathes inside browsers. In this blog post, I show a cool example on how you can start and stop video playback using the scroll position.

### [Create a URL shortener with Cloudflare Workers](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/creating-url-shortener-cloudflare-workers/)

Cloudflare Workers have been a hot topic for a while now. I finally decided to dive in and build what I always wanted - a small URL shortener. The blog post includes a bunch of ready-to-go code snippets, examples, and a full working repo for you to test out.

And, as always, I have some interesting links for you.

## üìö Useful resources

[Maybe you should do less 'work'](https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/work)

There's been a lot of hush around:

- _The Great Resignation_
- _The Great Reset_
- _Quiet Quitting_
- _Quiet Firing_

This blog post is a bit gentle and doesn't use any of these terms. Instead, the author goes about how much 'work' work you should do and what else you should be focusing on while 'working'.

That's it, no second link. Maybe I should really do less here. Let me know what you think. In the meantime, I'll focus on bookmarking more interesting resources and reads for you.

Thanks for tuning in. Let me know how you like the new blog post and the link I shared.

Catch you in the next one,

Nikola
