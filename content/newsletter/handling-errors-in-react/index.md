# Handling Errors in React

Hi there,

Here's what has happened on the Pragmatic Pineapple blog in the last month.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [How to Handle Errors in React](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-to-hande-errors-in-react/)

I have always wanted to write about this. Don't you hate it when your app suddenly becomes unresponsive? Or when the screen goes blank? Then, you open up the browser console and there's an error that happened. In this blog post, we explore ways on how your app can recover from these and show a message to the user.

And, as always, I have some peculiar links for you.

## üìö Useful resources

### [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)

Are you a terminal/command line fan but hate all things frontend? Well, I got something for you. A great way to learn React by building cool CLI tools. You must be asking in disgust - WHAT?! Yeah, write React - get a command line tool. Try it out, apparently, it is really popular. I might do a blog post on it.

### [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)

One of my favorite websites/posts I discovered recently. Not sure if its trolling or showing a very, very true reality. Anyways, here's a sneak peek from the post:

> apex predator of grug is complexity
> complexity bad
> say again:
> complexity very bad
> you say now:
> complexity very, very bad

There are also cool links at the end of that page. I will reshare those in some other issue of the newsletter.

That‚Äôs it for now, thanks for tuning in. Let me know how you like the new blog post and the links I shared.

Catch you in the next one,

Nikola
