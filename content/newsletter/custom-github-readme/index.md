# Custom GitHub README

Hi there,

Here's what has happened on the Pragmatic Pineapple blog since the last newsletter issue.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [Adding custom HTML and CSS to GitHub README](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/adding-custom-html-and-css-to-github-readme/)

Ever wanted to render something cool inside a GitHub README for your profile/repo? Look no further, here's how to do it. We will learn how to put HTML and CSS into an SVG. Yes, an SVG file. Read on.

### [A Guide to Service Workers](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/a-guide-to-service-workers/)

Are you scratching your head when someone mentions "workers"? I was doing that and decided to dive deep and figure out what kinds of Web Workers are out there. Check out this guide where we focus on Service Workers and compare them to others.

### [What's New in Next.js 13](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/whats-new-in-nextjs-13/)

All the news from Next.js 13 version. You might want to read this. Now, Remix and Next.js are almost head-to-head in features.

### [How to Preview localhost Website on Mobile Phone](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-to-preview-localhost-website-on-mobile-phone/)

A small, easily digestible read for the holidays coming up. It is about previewing your work on an actual mobile phone (or tablet, or anything that has a browser and is on your WiFi network). Why? Because sometimes, the responsive view in developer tools in browsers doesn't paint the right picture.

And, as always, I have some interesting links for you.

## üìö Useful resources

### [50 Useful Vim Commands](https://vimtricks.com/p/50-useful-vim-commands/)

Yeah, Vim. Here's the list of the most useful commands you'll need. View them even if you see yourself as a Vim pro. BTW, I switched to Neovim recently. I'll write about that soon.

### [s‚Ääl‚Ääo‚Ääw r‚Ääo‚Ääa‚Ääd‚Ääs](https://slowroads.io/)

Relax, holidays are coming up and what better way to wind down than making a road trip in an EV. This procedurally generated game lets you do just that - drive (or ride) a random terrain (or even Mars-like planet).

Thanks for tuning in. Let me know how you like the new blog post and the links I shared. And happy holidays! üéâ

Catch you in the next one,

Nikola
