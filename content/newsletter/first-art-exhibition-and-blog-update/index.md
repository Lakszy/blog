# First Art Exhibition + Blog Update

Hi there,

This is a _hand-made_ update on what happened on the Pragmatic Pineapple blog since the last newsletter issue.

## 🖼 Exhibition

I have to share that I have a photography ongoing exhibition in Novi Sad, Serbia called Analog USA. You can view it at American Corner Novi Sad until April 5th.

I created a website for it [https://www.ripefilm.photo/analog-usa/](https://www.ripefilm.photo/analog-usa/) and you can read the stories.

If you want to support me, you can [buy the digital version of the exhibition catalog here](https://ko-fi.com/s/bd3d065a7d). It would mean a lot and it will keep the running costs of my hobby + it will be a huge motivation for me 😍

## ✨ New on the blog

I've been busy with the art exhibition and was writing a lot for it. As far as the Pragmatic Pineapple goes, I mostly written as a guest author for Anima App and FatCat Coders blog, here are those blog posts if you're interested.
