Vim is great. I have been using different text editors and IDEs through years,
and Vim stuck with me through all hardships and happy times. Maybe because I
invested much time in learning and fine-tuning it to my needs that it became a
part of me, a bit.

With those lines, [one of the best Vim talks on YouTube starts](https://youtu.be/XA2WjJbmmoM?t=50).
And it makes perfect sense. I remember being frustrated and asking why would
anyone use Vim while I was learning it. But all that paid struggle off. If you
are afraid of the Vim learning curve, I found this great
[post](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth) that
proclaims you can learn Vim 30 minutes!

One of the main reasons why I use Vim as my editor is speed. And I do not mean
the speed of writing code, which is also excellent. I am thinking of the reading speed
of the code. Did you know that the [ratio of reading versus writing code is 10 to 1](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/835238-indeed-the-ratio-of-time-spent-reading-versus-writing-is).
That means that you are regularly reading old code to write new code.
And with Vim, **reading** and **finding** old code has been the easiest and
fastest for me!

I will explain in another blog post which plugins and shortcuts I use, so be
sure to [subscribe to the newsletter](/newsletter).

## VSCode vs. Vim

A lot of folks are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
for development. I do not blame them. I have used VSCode and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
and it is one of the best software that came out of Microsoft!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">when people ask me to recommend a text editor <a href="https://t.co/ZCbU54tJTb">pic.twitter.com/ZCbU54tJTb</a></p>&mdash; Tim Pope (@tpope) <a href="https://twitter.com/tpope/status/1172743697315835904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most recently, I have been using VSCode for writing (and reading) [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
code. Why you'd ask? Well, before I made an ultimate Vim TypeScript
setup, I had to use VSCode. The only reason why I used VSCode, was that Vim was
too slow for editing TypeScript files.

Luckily, I have upgraded Vim to [8.2 version](https://www.vim.org/vim-8.2-released.php),
and it started to be blazing fast once again. I ditched VSCode and moved
back to Vim and [my .vimrc](https://github.com/nikolalsvk/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).

If you are thinking about the two, I would say to use Vim, but I am probably biased.
[VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) lets you combine the best of two worlds,
and this is what I was using in my Visual Studio Code setup.

Upgrading to the new Vim version meant I could finally savor the sweet ~~fruits~~
plugins of the Vim and TypeScript ecosystem.

## Vim and TypeScript

To get you started with using TypeScript and Vim together, I will show plugins for
syntax highlighting:

- [pangloss/vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) provides syntax highlight and indentation for JavaScript in general
- [leafgarland/typescript-vim](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim) provides syntax highlight for TypeScript
- [maxmellon/vim-jsx-pretty](https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty) support for JSX highlighting

These three will suit all of your needs. If you are using GraphQL, there is
[vim-graphql](https://github.com/jparise/vim-graphql) that works nicely for me.

After you add all of these plugins, this is how a React component looks like:

![Vim TSX](./typescript-highlight.png)

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to install plugins, but
with new Vim 8.2, you can add plugins to `~/.vim/pack/some-package/` like
described in [vimhelp.org](https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#packages).

To add these plugins in your `.vimrc` using vim-plug, you can do the following:

```vim
Plug 'pangloss/vim-javascript'    " JavaScript support
Plug 'leafgarland/typescript-vim' " TypeScript syntax
Plug 'maxmellon/vim-jsx-pretty'   " JS and JSX syntax
Plug 'jparise/vim-graphql'        " GraphQL syntax
```

Then, install these plugins with `:PlugInstall` or use this shortcut I use:

```vim
" Source Vim configuration file and install plugins
nnoremap <silent><leader>1 :source ~/.vimrc \| :PlugInstall<CR>
```

You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your `.vimrc`.

Now, to the coolest part!

## Code completions

Coding in Visual Studio Code was pretty nice, and I got used to having suggestions as I type.
Luckily, there is the same thing for Vim! A plugin called [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
has made my development experience so much better! Conquer of Completion, or
CoC for short, is similar to
[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) and [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) plugins,
but I found it easier to configure.

This of the CoC as a swiss-army knife of a Vim plugin. It is largely inspired
by VSCode and has a full Language Server Protocol support. We can picture the Language Server
Protocol or LSP as a middle-man between the language tooling and
code editors. In other words, you only need to write one protocol for
TypeScript and have it reused for different editors. I best understood the idea
from a diagram below:

![LSP explanation](./lsp-languages-editors.png)

To set up `coc.nvim` plugin, you need to include the plugin in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
```

Having plugin by itself will not be enough for a full-on VSCode-like experience
with TypeScript. To have code completion show up for TypeScript, you need to install
[coc-tsserver](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-tsserver). The reason for this is that CoC
works with extensions. There are many extensions that you can use, and more on why
extensions are needed is [in CoC Wiki](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions).

In our case, we will use `coc-tsserver` extension that we can install with `:CocInstall coc-tsserver`. Or, you can put
this line in your `.vimrc` which I find better:

```vim
" CoC extensions
let g:coc_global_extensions = ['coc-tsserver']
```

At this point, you should start seeing language server errors highlighted with
associated icons in the gutter, and cursoring over the errors will show the
error or warning message.

![TypeScript error](./coc-typescript-error.png)

Not only that, but you will be able to do autocomplete and get code fix
suggestions! Similar to VSCode. In the GIF below, I'll try to add a styled
container to the 404 page of my blog.

![Typing TypeScript](./writing-typescript.gif)

I am also showing which keys I'm pressing in the bottom left corner of the GIF
so you get a sense of what is going on in Vim. To sum up, I have created a
`Container` variable that is using `styled.div`. After that, I am including
`<Container>` in my code, but the TS Server is complaining that `styled` cannot
be found. Then, I'm using a shortcut to view code fixes, and I choose to import
styled.

I took some of the tricks from [example Vim configuration from the coc.nvim repo](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim#example-vim-configuration)
which you should definitely check out!

One of the shortcuts I used in the GIF above is leader key + ac:

```vim
" Remap keys for applying codeAction to the current line.
nmap <leader>ac  <Plug>(coc-codeaction)
" Apply AutoFix to problem on the current line.
nmap <leader>qf  <Plug>(coc-fix-current)
```

The last one will apply a quick fix immediately by pressing leader + qf.
Besides that, my configuration is pretty simple. I also use the following:

```vim
" Show autocomplete when Tab is pressed
inoremap <silent><expr> <Tab> coc#refresh()


" GoTo code navigation.
nmap <silent> gd <Plug>(coc-definition)
nmap <silent> gy <Plug>(coc-type-definition)
nmap <silent> gi <Plug>(coc-implementation)
nmap <silent> gr <Plug>(coc-references)
```

The `gd`, `gy`, `gi`, `gr` it useful when jumping around the code trying to
figure out where code is being defined and referenced from. This is why I love
Vim and it lets me be fast with writing and reading code! To better illustrate,
here is a GIF of jumping between the definition of the SEO component and where
it is referenced.
