There are many ways to test a Ruby on Rails application, but there is one
way that is not so often discussed. That is the way of testing Rails views.
Yes - there are controller, model, and other types of tests, but we rarely see
the view layer tests. Let's give them more attention and see what they are all
about.

You might ask - well, why don't you write integration tests and test view layer
with them? I could, but running integration tests can be slow, and writing a
simple view 'unit' test can be more straightforward. Plus, RSpec has great support for
writing a view spec. What is even more interesting, I created
[an example project](https://github.com/nikolalsvk/rails-view-testing) to test these out. Let's see what I found out.

## New Project, Who This

I created new Rails 6.1 project, installed RSpec, and generated the Book model with:

```bash
bin/rails generate scaffold Book title:string description:text download_url:string status:string
```

And look at what I got generated:

```bash
...

    create      spec/views/books/edit.html.erb_spec.rb
    create      spec/views/books/index.html.erb_spec.rb
    create      spec/views/books/new.html.erb_spec.rb
    create      spec/views/books/show.html.erb_spec.rb

...
```

If we take a look at one of the specs, we can find the following code:

```rb
# spec/views/books/index.html.erb_spec.rb

require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "books/index", type: :view do
  before(:each) do
    assign(:books, [
      Book.create!(
        title: "Title",
        description: "MyText",
        download_url: "Download Url",
        status: "Status"
      ),
      Book.create!(
        title: "Title",
        description: "MyText",
        download_url: "Download Url",
        status: "Status"
      )
    ])
  end

  it "renders a list of books" do
    render
    assert_select "tr>td", text: "Title".to_s, count: 2
    assert_select "tr>td", text: "MyText".to_s, count: 2
    assert_select "tr>td", text: "Download Url".to_s, count: 2
    assert_select "tr>td", text: "Status".to_s, count: 2
  end
end
```

There's the `type: view` that indicates the special type of specs. We will go
into this later a bit. You can distinguish `assign` and `render` methods that
indicate that they are defined internally and not something we should
provide. But, there is also one thing sticking into my eyes as I go through
this test.

What's interesting here, this `assert_select` matcher looks a bit "deprecated"
or like it is not from the RSpec world. There's no class `expect(...).to`
formation. What happened here is that the template for generating these specs
got a bit dusty. It didn't change from 2010, when it was originally pushed to
the repo. You can find the commit that brought the `assert_select`
[here on GitHub](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/commit/800a56402ced481ae5b531e9a1d1a69bc8f66e90).

No worries, I didn't see many projects using view specs, let alone
generating models and relying on those generated view specs. I guess that is
why nobody took out the time to refactor or improve the existing template. But,
since this blog post is about focusing our attention on Rails view testing,
let us try to do just that.

## Spring Cleaning

If we take a look at the [docs for view specs in RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/view-specs/view-spec), we
can see that almost all of them use the following:

```rb
expect(rendered).to match /something/
```

We can use `match` and `include` from RSpec. What we get is a test that looks
like this:

```rb
# spec/views/books/index.html.erb_spec.rb

require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "books/index", type: :view do
  before(:each) do
    assign(:books, [
      Book.create!(
        title: "Rails Testing",
        description: "How to test Ruby on Rails applications.",
        download_url: nil,
        status: "draft"
      ),
      Book.create!(
        title: "Rails Patterns",
        description: "A book about patterns and anti-patterns in Ruby on Rails.",
        download_url: "rails-patterns.com/download",
        status: "published"
      )
    ])
  end

  it "renders a list of books" do
    render

    expect(rendered).to match(/Rails Testing/)
    expect(rendered).to include("Rails Patterns")

    expect(rendered).to match(/How to test Ruby on Rails applications./)
    expect(rendered).to include("A book about patterns and anti-patterns in Ruby on Rails.")

    expect(rendered).to include("rails-patterns.com/download")

    expect(rendered).to include("published")
  end
end
```

The previous test feels more like a RSpec spec. But, we can notice is that we lost that
ability to check whether the actual content is inside a certain HTML tag.
`assert_select` gives us more flexibility in matching the expected result.
There's more options you can pass to `assert_select` in
[its docs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Assertions/SelectorAssertions.html#method-i-assert_select).
I suggest you choose the option you feel gives you more control.

## Utilizing Capybara

If you have Capybara installed, you can utilize its selectors like so:

```rb
require "rails_helper"

RSpec.describe "books/index", type: :view do
  before(:each) do
    assign(:books, [
      Book.create!(
        title: "Rails Testing",
        description: "How to test Ruby on Rails applications.",
        download_url: nil,
        status: "draft"
      ),
      Book.create!(
        title: "Rails Patterns",
        description: "A book about patterns and anti-patterns in Ruby on Rails.",
        download_url: "rails-patterns.com/download",
        status: "published"
      )
    ])
  end

  it "renders a list of books" do
    render

    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "Rails Testing")
    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "Rails Patterns")

    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "How to test Ruby on Rails applications")
    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "A book about patterns and anti-patterns in Ruby on Rails.")

    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "rails-patterns.com/download")

    expect(rendered).to have_selector("tr>td", text: "published")
  end
end
```

Now, you get both RSpec `expect(...).to`, and you get the granularity of
asserting that text is inside a table row. You can find all of the code and examples
[in the repo here](https://github.com/nikolalsvk/rails-view-testing). But why
would you use any of these? Let's discuss below.

## Why View Specs

We skimmed over a couple of reasons why you would write a view spec. The idea
is to test some conditional logic you have in your views or partials. Writing
an integration test that covers all the branches inside your views can be slow
to run and painful to write. The view specs bring a great balance between:

- üí∏ cost of development,
- üèç speed of execution, and
- üîÄ conditional rendering coverage.

Of course, you might not need view specs at all if you have decorators and view
models, form objects, and all other goodies that can move the logic out of the
view for you. But, sometimes, in the real world, not every code base is
perfectly designed, and you have to cut corners from time to time.

Whether it is some kind of stakeholder breathing down your neck. Or it's
the complicated legacy partial that can't be so easily extracted to a design of
your choice. Whatever the reason is, you might opt-in for the view spec to move
fast and have the logic tested.

And when that day comes (or it already came), you can resort back to this blog
post and use it to your liking.
