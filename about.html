        <h3>Short summary</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Born in 1993 in Novi Sad, Serbia. Raised in Veternik, place where I
          live currently.  Attented "Isidora Sekulić" grammar school in Novi
          Sad. Finished Faculty of Techincal Sciences in Novi Sad also. Got a
          job in Novi Sad. You can say I'm pretty attached to the city I grew
          up in.
        </p>

        <h3>The Begginings (elementary and high school)</h3>
        <p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Since I was a kid I was into computers, playing around with MS DOS my
          on a computer my father had bought for small grocery shop he owned.
          This is what got me into computers, playing <strong>Prince of
          Percia</strong> and <strong>Alladin</strong> on an that old computer,
          knowing there's more to it.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          In the middle of elemenatry school, I got really interested in
          motorcycles and MotoGP. I was also watching Orange County Choppers on
          Discovery Channel and wanted to build my own bike. Luckily my father
          had <strong>Tomos A3L</strong> that I restored (painted and tinkered
          around) until I got it into mint condition. Back then I wanted to
          become a mechanic and enroll into school of that sort.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          In parallel to my biking passion, I was attending extra-curriculum
          classes in elementary school trying to get more into computers. In
          those classes in elementary school is where I build my first program
          and at that time, it didn't feel good as fixing or riding a
          motorcycle. First thing I build was a prank, it was a program
          when run would show a button "Don't click me" and if you clicked it
          your computer would shut down. Yeah, I was a prankster.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          Eventually I'd enroll into grammar school and pursue my programming
          furthermore, while slowly less wanting to become a mechanic, and more
          wanting to do something with computers. In the grammar school I
          programmed in <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Delphi</strong>,
          which I didn't like as much, I was always more of a eye-candy kind of
          guy. I wanted to build something that is more elegant and beautiful.
        </p>

        <h3>University days</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The desire to built something more beautiful and useful than high
          school programs fueled me to get into Faculty of Technical Sciences
          in Computer Science. At first I was lost, it felt like it wasn't the
          right path for me. But eventually, around second year of university,
          I started to like programming and kinda fell in love with the process
          of writing code.
        </p>

        <h3>Intership and my first love</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">
          After experimenting with different things in university, like Java,
          compilers optimization and such, I mostly liked web development. I
          hated coding in Java, and knew there must be something more appealing
          than plain Java. There came internship at Rendered Text, where I was
          introduced to <strong>Ruby</strong> (and Ruby on Rails). It was kind
          of a love at first sight. Way it preaches self-improvent and
          self-teaching, and how simple it is - made me awestruck.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          I can now with confidence say that the Ruby is my favourite
          programming lanugage and I cannot stop loving it. Nowdays I'm
          focusing on Rails, Elixir, Javascript (React and Angular) and I
          really want to get more into machine learning (more than I've done it
          in university)
